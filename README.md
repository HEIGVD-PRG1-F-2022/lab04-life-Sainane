## Description

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton
Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It
is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

This project is a reproduction in C++ of the Game of Life. The user interface and output is in the console. This program
allows the user to make his/her own pattern or choose from a few suggested patterns. The user can also choose if the
grid is of fixed size and closed on itself or adaptive, meaning it grows or shrink to the minimum size that allows to see the
alive cells.

## Setup
### Requirement
* C++20
* Cmake 2.23 or newer
* Able to launch the executable in console

### Building and running
* Clone project
* Build program
* For better experience, launch program in terminal and put it in full screen, the quality of game output may differ depending on the terminal used

## Execution
For each menu, press the number in front of the option you want and press enter
* Starting scrren, press enter to start
* Grid selection
* Choose how to initialise the grid
* * Freely
* * With suggested patterns 
*
